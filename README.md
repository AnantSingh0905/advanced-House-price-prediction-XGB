# Project Title:  
**Advanced House Price Prediction using XGBoost**

## Project Overview:  
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on the **XGBoost** algorithm. The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. The objective is to build a model that can predict the final price of a house based on various features such as the number of rooms, square footage, location, and more.

## Project Workflow:

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization
- Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, handle missing values, outliers, etc.
- Use libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for visualizing important features.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Handling missing data and outliers.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling numerical variables.

### 3. Modeling with XGBoost
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Implement the **XGBoost** algorithm.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Use **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) as the primary evaluation metric.

## Results:
The final model achieved an **RMSE of 0.12958** on the test dataset. This indicates the model's performance in predicting house prices is reasonably accurate based on the given dataset.
